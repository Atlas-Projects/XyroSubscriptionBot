ðŸ’¸ **Become an Affiliate and Earn with Us!** ðŸ’¸

Our Affiliate Program makes it easy to earn commissions by referring new customers. Here\'s how it works:

**ðŸ”— How You Earn:**  
- Earn **10-15%% of the purchase amount** each month, for up to 12-18 months, or for as long as the customer keeps payingâ€”whichever comes first.  
- For top-performing affiliates with multiple referrals, this payout can extend even longer, matching your customers\' ongoing subscriptions!  

**ðŸ’° Your Earnings:**  
- If you have an active subscription, your subscription price will automatically reduce by the amount you\'ve earned in affiliate commissions.  
- If you don\'t have an active subscription, or if your earnings exceed your subscription price, we\'ll pay you out via **TON** or **USDT** after 21 days (in line with Telegram\'s Stars Terms), provided the total is above the minimum payout threshold.

**ðŸ”— How to Get Started:**  
- Use our affiliate link systemâ€”each referral is tracked via a unique deep-link URL provided by our bot.  
- When someone joins through your link, you\'re automatically tagged as their referrer. If they\'ve been referred more than once, the **latest affiliate** gets the credit.

**ðŸ’¬ Affiliate Updates:**  
- Affiliates are instantly alerted each time a new subscription is purchased through their referral link.  
- In the case of a refund, you\'ll also receive a notification.  
- While cancellation alerts won\'t be sent, you can always check your **earnings** and **active clients** with a dedicated command.

**ðŸ”’ Redemption & Payouts:**  
- Commissions are manually approved, with no cap on earnings!  
- Earnings are rounded up to the nearest whole number upon redemption, ensuring you get every bit you\'ve earned.

ðŸ‘‹ **Hey, {0}!**

Thinking about sharing our bot, **{1}**, and earning some extra cash along the way? It\'s easy! Just share your unique link: **{2}** ðŸ“²

When someone clicks your link and makes a qualifying subscription purchase, you\'ll get an instant alert and a **commission** on their purchase. Exciting, right? ðŸŽ‰

But that\'s not all! The more customers you refer, the more your commission grows, thanks to our **tiered affiliate levels**. So your earnings can keep building as your referrals add up. ðŸ“ˆ

Here\'s how it works:  
- Once your commission reaches a minimum of **{3} XTR**, you can withdraw it, or even put it towards your own subscription!  
- If you do decide to subscribe, you\'ll see your commission automatically reduce the subscription priceâ€”keeping more in your pocket. ðŸ’¸

Want to check on your commissions or see your active clients? Just use **`/commission`** at any time to stay updated on your progress.

Ready to get started? Share your link and let the rewards roll in! ðŸš€
